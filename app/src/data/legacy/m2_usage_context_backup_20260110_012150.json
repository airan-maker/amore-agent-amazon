I finally decided to try this stuff out after seeing it constantly trend on tiktok and I am so glad I did! My skin no longer feels tight and the congestion of little bumps on my forehead have almost gone away. I also noticed my makeup looked more smooth and flawless when it would look cakey and flaky before! Even though it is a little pricey, it’s worth it!! All I did was use water to wash my face in the morning (oil cleanser at night), tone, snail mucin, and moisturizer!Update: it’s been almost 3 weeks of using this daily (morning and night) and it’s become a STAPLE in my everyday routine. I’ve always had tiny closed comedones on the sides of my cheeks that never went away for years and because this serum is completely restoring my barrier, my skin was finally able to push out all the enclosed sebum and the comedones have been rubbing off when I wash my face ever since!\n  \nRead more",

I was pleased to find that the skin of my dreams in a Korean beauty inspired routine. The best part is that nearly all the products I tried were relatively inexpensive and readily available from amazon. My acne is non-existent now and the tone and texture of my skin is so supple and smooth. I have provided a list of my routine below which includes  this product. I’m not saying this is the best or only way to achieve my results, I just thought others would be interested in what I used.*indicates review for this productAM- hydrating, lightweight, works under makeupCleanser - BOOTS Botanics All Bright Gentle Cleansing Cream (purchased from Ulta for a fraction of the price $6.99)First Toner- Mario Badescu Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs and Rosewater, 4 oz.– $7.00 - This is like a drink of water for your face. I love this stuff and will spray again randomly throughout the day whenever I need a refresher. The aroma is a little strong for my liking but (almost like perfume) but I’m willing to overlook since the rose and aloe does so much for my skin. I used to use just straight rose water which has a very present smell but I like the spray delivery of this product better.Moisturizing Toner-[Skin Food] Premium Avocado Rich Toner 180ml –$12.98 -  I can’t say enough about this. It’s a nice thick toner much more substantial that the western watery toners I was used to. The smell of this is very bright and green (that’s the best way I can think of to explain it) I love the smell! Every now and then I will smell it on my face and it gives me an invigorating boost. This toner works well to moisturize and calm my skin and will certainly be re-purchasing. A little goes a long way with this stuff so that won’t be for quite some time!Treatment- Body Merry Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Anti-aging with Vitamic C and Natural Green Tea, 2 Oz– $13.99 - I use this during the day to keep my skin feeling hydrated and give my skin the boost of anti-oxidants to help combat ageing. This is a lightweight serum (which is why I use it under my makeup) but it does take some time to fully absorb in and dry on my skin. After I put this on I generally go and have breakfast before coming back to finish. The aroma leans more towards green tea which again I find refreshing for the morning. The syrup is a milky and slightly viscous with minimal stickiness.Eye Cream- Loreal Revitalift Eye Cream 0.5 Ounce (14ml) (14ml) – (Purchased  from Ulta)Face Cream- [MIZON] Snail Recovery Gel Cream 45ml (1.52 fl.oz.) Pack of 2– $9.99/ 2-pack  - Lightweight moisturizer which works perfectly under makeup. This product doesn’t’ have much of a smell. The consistency is unique halfway between a gel and a cream. Glides on smoothly and provides a decent amount of hydration when combines with my other hydrating products. I don’t like to use occlusive products during the day and this moisturizer fits the bill.PM-all about Snail- Repair, Hydrated, MoisturizeMakeup Remover- Boots Botanics All Bright Soothing Eye Make-up Remover 5 oz. – Purchased at Ulta for a fraction of the price - $6.99Double Cleanse -[Total 2Pcs] The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Cleansing Oil + Foam SET –$14.21 -  The oil cleanser feels light and silky. At night, I massage 1 pump into my skin and works well to dissolve the days make-up. Once I am done breaking down all the makeup, I use water to get some of it off before moving to the foam cleanser. My only complaint is that the fragrance is a little strong and can burn my eyes if I’m not careful. It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. The foam cleanser works well to clean off the oil left on my face. The foam cleanser aroma is a lot more tolerable to me. It comes out of the tube a shimmery white color and is Very gentle. These two cleansers work well to get my face clean and ready for treatments without that typical tight feeling. They leave my skin soft and moisturized.Exfoliation -  Olay Regenerist Microdermabrasion & Peel System Microdermabrasion Treatment 1 Kit - $21.99 - one a week - I used to use philosophy's microderm kit but this one offers the same exact results for 1/2 of the price. This exfoliator leaves my skin feeling baby soft but it does seem a tad harsh so I don't like to use it too frequently. I love the fresh citrus smell of the crystals and the warming foaming action once you put on the activator. Since I only use this once a week it lasts for a VERY long time and is totally worth the price.Toner- [Skin Food] Premium Avocado Rich Toner 180ml –$12.98  I can’t say enough about this. It’s a nice thick toner much more substantial that the western watery toners I was used to. The smell of this is very bright and green (that’s the best way I can think of to explain it) I love the smell! Every now and then I will smell it on my face and it gives me an invigorating boost. This toner works well to moisturize and calm my skin and will certainly be re-purchasing. A little goes a long way with this stuff so that won’t be for quite some time!*Essence - [Cosrx] Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence 100ml – $15.85 - I only use this at night because it does leave bit of a film on my face which I find unpleasant under make up. It dries quickly and a single pump gives me enough to cover my whole face and neck. There is no smell to speak of but it does have a slimy snail-y texture ( it is 96% slime!) and can be a bit tacky once its all said and done.  I have also used this on some iron burns to help it heal faster and minimize scaring with a lot of success.Treatment-MIZON Snail Repair Intensive Ampoule - Anti Wrinkle - Multi Function Formula - $11.43 -  Anti Wrinkle - Multi Function Formula- Clear viscous liquid. Not nearly as slimy as the essence. No smell, absorbs quickly. I focus heavily on the snail products at night because I read that the copper peptides naturally contained in the snail canalter the effectiveness of the vitamin C and vice versa.Spot Treatment-[MIZON] Acence Blemish Out Pink Spot 30ml– $14.95 - Use only as needed – Works wonders to diminish blemishes overnight. I used this quite frequently when I first started but after a while using all these products I didn’t have any acne to speak of!Sheet Mask - Dermal Korea Collagen Essence Full Face Facial Mask Sheet, 16 Combo Pack – $10.40 - I use once a week. I know that sheet masks are the totally hot thing in Korean beauty but I don’t think they do much for me other than a relaxing home spa experience. I just don’t see that they provide much and probably  will not be buying more.Eye Cream- MIZON Korean Cosmetics Snail Repair Eye Cream, 1 Ounce 1 Ounce – $13.98 -  Light weight, absorbs quickly. The container is quite generous and a little will go a long way. I think I will have this for a while! It doesn’t have any smell.Face Cream- MIZON Black Snail All In One Cream, 2.40 Ounce –$10.49 -  Like all of the Mizon Snail products I have tried this is a very easy introduction into the world of snail skin care. It has minimum smell and lightweight texture. Minimal slime factor, you wouldn’t even know it was snail in a blind comparison.  It has a off white color and a lightweight consistency. It doesn’t work wall as an occlusive if that’s what you want you may need to add a different moisturizer at night.Face Oils- I use a mixture of two oils applied at once: Radha Beauty Rosehip Oil 4 oz - 100% Pure Cold Pressed Certified Organic. - $13.95 -  and Radha Beauty Moroccan Argan Oil for Hair, Face & Skin 4 oz - USDA Organic 100% Pure Cold pressed Virgin Oil From Morocco - By Radha Beauty –$12.95 -  I like to use the oils last because I feel like it really seals everything in and provides moisture to last me through the night. The rosehip oil is very yellow orange so I wouldn’t recommend using during the day abut I do sometimes mix the Argan oil in with my foundation if I want a dewier look.\n  \nRead more",

              "text": "I’ve been using the Aquaphor Lip Repair Stick for a few weeks now, and it’s quickly become my go-to lip balm. Here’s my review:Moisturizing & Hydration:This lip balm is incredibly moisturizing and does an excellent job of keeping my lips soft and hydrated. I suffer from dry, chapped lips, especially during the colder months, and the Aquaphor Lip Repair Stick provides immediate relief. It has a rich, thick formula that isn’t greasy, but it locks in moisture for hours. I don’t need to reapply it constantly, which is a huge plus.Texture & Application:The texture is smooth and soothing, gliding easily over my lips without feeling sticky or heavy. It has a non-waxy feel, which I really appreciate. It absorbs quickly and leaves my lips feeling nourished without any residue. The stick form is easy to apply and mess-free, so it’s perfect for on-the-go use.Effectiveness:Aquaphor is known for its healing properties, and this lip repair stick lives up to the brand’s reputation. It works wonders on cracked or irritated lips, providing immediate relief and helping to heal them faster. Whether I’m dealing with winter dryness or a bit of sunburn, it soothes and repairs quickly.Scent & Flavor:There’s no overwhelming scent or flavor, which I actually prefer. It’s very neutral, so it’s great for those who don’t want a heavily scented or flavored lip product. The lack of scent also makes it ideal for men and women alike, as it’s not too sweet or perfumed.Packaging:The packaging is simple and functional. The twist-up mechanism works smoothly, and the cap stays secure, so I don’t have to worry about it coming off in my bag. It’s compact and portable, making it easy to throw in my purse or pocket for quick use throughout the day.Drawbacks:One minor drawback is that it’s a bit thicker than other lip balms, so if you’re looking for something that feels lighter or more matte, this might not be your top pick. Additionally, while it’s great for repairing dry lips, I wouldn’t necessarily use it as a daily lip balm if I wanted something with a more cosmetic finish or a hint of color.Final Thoughts:Overall, I’m really impressed with the Aquaphor Lip Repair Stick. It’s highly effective, hydrating, and provides long-lasting relief for dry, cracked lips. If you suffer from chapped lips or need something that helps heal and protect your lips, this is a must-try. It’s become my favorite go-to lip treatment, especially in the colder months!\n  \nRead more",

This is cheaper (in Aus at least) than from any chemist (inc. chemist warehouse) (chemists sell it individually, 4 - 6 each) If you know you like Burt's Bees and plan to use many more, I suggest you buy this 4 pack (I used 1 lipbalm in more or less a year, but these have long expiry dates) But let's say you didn't like Burt's Bees. Well then, please understand that this lipbalm is natural and (I think?) healthy. The reason I would not use vaseline (plain petroleum gel) is because it is not very convenient, but I do suggest using vaseline overnight and this lighter lipbalm during the day. The different flavours are extremely fun to use (coconut and pear is amazing too!) but the original vitamin e and peppermint is definitely an essential.\n  \nRead more",

The tubes are small but convenient, and having two is perfect for keeping one at home and one in my bag.

Both my mature skin and my daughter’s teenage skin showed visible improvement using these masks just once a week, addressing different needs while delivering consistent hydration and skin-smoothing results.The mask provides excellent moisture and leaves the skin feeling smooth, supple, glowing, and refreshed without irritation or stickiness. We use these both alongside other products from this line and in combination with other highly rated skincare brands, and they integrate well into a broader routine.What stands out most is the value. While not inexpensive, these masks rival far more expensive, luxury and prescription-grade skincare products we’ve used in the past—without the gimmicks. The quality and results justify the cost, must smell is wonderful, and this brand has become a regular part of our skincare routine.\n  \nRead more",

I later read that wearing a mask for that long may not be ideal for oily/acne prone skin because it can trap assess oil and clog pores, but so far, after two uses, it seems to be working ok for me.

There were two choices I think the one is a four-pack and the one I got is a 16 pack. The 16 pack will last you 4 months if you're doing it once a week as instructed.I open the top and two sides when I'm doing it just to have accessibility and to be able to use the remnants liquid in the pack after I'm done applying the facial part I put the liquid in the pack on my neck and chest.They are a little slippery when you take them out. I watched a video on how to apply it and did the bottom part first and then the top part sometimes I have to snip the top part near the nose to get it to fit properly but you don't have to in general.There are three pieces that are left over the two eye pieces and the lip piece. You can put them below your eyes or above your eyes on your brows and then put the mask over them which is what I do. Or you can put them under your eyes and put the mask over them but I find it doesn't absorb all the way in that location due to the double thickness I guess. The lip one you can put over your lip or put it on vertically over your throat where the skin can get a little saggy.Once you have it on it's best to sit back and relax for 30 minutes or so at about a 45° angle so it doesn't slip off. After about 10 to 15 minutes it doesn't slip around as much and after 30 it's obviously started absorbing and tends to stay pretty well.I haven't noticed any staining on the pillows or anything like that from it and by morning actually by 4 hours later it's completely absorbed and all you have left on your faces the plastic that it was attached to. You just pull that off and throw it away. It's white when you put it on and it's clear when it absorbs.I definitely noticed an improvement in my skin quality and the collagen sinks in easily and less about a week. I am a redhead with delicate skin and I haven't had any reaction to this product at all I know that other masks have caused problems for friends but I've used this one for over a year now and I love it. My daughter and I both use it weekly and they're easy to take with you if you're traveling great way to pamper your skin after a day outside on the beach.The price is reasonable for what it is and what it does. I've gotten several compliments on my skin and I'm over 60 so that saying something for the results!All in all this is a very good product, it doesn't smell and doesn't seem to have any impurities like some others. My skin isn't irritated by it and looks great afterwards. If you're wondering if it washes off once it's soaked in you can wash your face all you want but you're just going to have beautiful glowing cheeks. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this or give it as a gift!\n  \nRead more",
