I wake up with smooth, pillowy lips instead of the dry, cracked mess I used to have by morning. The Berry scent is soft and sweet and the formula feels rich without being sticky 🍓💕What makes it work so well is the combo of vitamin C, murumuru and shea butter, and antioxidants. It seals in moisture, softens peeling lips, and repairs damage while you sleep, no effort required. That rich texture isn’t just for looks, it actually helps create a moisture barrier so everything stays locked in until morning.It’s become a nightly staple, especially if I’ve been wearing matte lipstick or dealing with dry weather. Even when I’ve forgotten to drink enough water (oops), this still saves me. A tiny amount goes a long way, I usually take a small scoop with the little spatula and apply it into my lips right before bed. You don’t need to pile it on.Here’s a quick tip if you’re new to lip masks: make sure your lips are clean and dry before applying, and press the product in gently with your finger or the applicator so it absorbs evenly. If you exfoliate beforehand, the results are even better 💦🛏️My lips feel insanely soft by morning. It smooths away flakiness overnight, smells like berries without being too strong, and leaves a glossy but not messy finish that doesn’t transfer all over your pillow 💋✨This is one of those products that quietly earns its place. If you’ve got dry lips or wear long lasting lipstick often, it’s absolutely worth the hype.\n  \nRead more",

Here’s my review:Moisturizing & Hydration:This lip balm is incredibly moisturizing and does an excellent job of keeping my lips soft and hydrated. I suffer from dry, chapped lips, especially during the colder months, and the Aquaphor Lip Repair Stick provides immediate relief. It has a rich, thick formula that isn’t greasy, but it locks in moisture for hours. I don’t need to reapply it constantly, which is a huge plus.Texture & Application:The texture is smooth and soothing, gliding easily over my lips without feeling sticky or heavy. It has a non-waxy feel, which I really appreciate. It absorbs quickly and leaves my lips feeling nourished without any residue. The stick form is easy to apply and mess-free, so it’s perfect for on-the-go use.Effectiveness:Aquaphor is known for its healing properties, and this lip repair stick lives up to the brand’s reputation. It works wonders on cracked or irritated lips, providing immediate relief and helping to heal them faster. Whether I’m dealing with winter dryness or a bit of sunburn, it soothes and repairs quickly.Scent & Flavor:There’s no overwhelming scent or flavor, which I actually prefer. It’s very neutral, so it’s great for those who don’t want a heavily scented or flavored lip product. The lack of scent also makes it ideal for men and women alike, as it’s not too sweet or perfumed.Packaging:The packaging is simple and functional. The twist-up mechanism works smoothly, and the cap stays secure, so I don’t have to worry about it coming off in my bag. It’s compact and portable, making it easy to throw in my purse or pocket for quick use throughout the day.Drawbacks:One minor drawback is that it’s a bit thicker than other lip balms, so if you’re looking for something that feels lighter or more matte, this might not be your top pick. Additionally, while it’s great for repairing dry lips, I wouldn’t necessarily use it as a daily lip balm if I wanted something with a more cosmetic finish or a hint of color.Final Thoughts:Overall, I’m really impressed with the Aquaphor Lip Repair Stick. It’s highly effective, hydrating, and provides long-lasting relief for dry, cracked lips. If you suffer from chapped lips or need something that helps heal and protect your lips, this is a must-try. It’s become my favorite go-to lip treatment, especially in the colder months!\n  \nRead more",

The tubes are small but convenient, and having two is perfect for keeping one at home and one in my bag. If you struggle with chronically dry lips, this is one of the few products that truly helps.\n  \nRead more",

I thought I was permanently cursed with chapped lips but I'd just been using stuff that didn't work well enough before, as even the more expensive lip balms didn't make much of a difference. This stuff actually IMPROVED the annoying dry skin situation with my lips instead of just making my lips FEEL better.\n  \nRead more",

Both my mature skin and my daughter’s teenage skin showed visible improvement using these masks just once a week, addressing different needs while delivering consistent hydration and skin-smoothing results.The mask provides excellent moisture and leaves the skin feeling smooth, supple, glowing, and refreshed without irritation or stickiness. We use these both alongside other products from this line and in combination with other highly rated skincare brands, and they integrate well into a broader routine.What stands out most is the value. While not inexpensive, these masks rival far more expensive, luxury and prescription-grade skincare products we’ve used in the past—without the gimmicks. The quality and results justify the cost, must smell is wonderful, and this brand has become a regular part of our skincare routine.\n  \nRead more",

I later read that wearing a mask for that long may not be ideal for oily/acne prone skin because it can trap assess oil and clog pores, but so far, after two uses, it seems to be working ok for me. I might try another Biodance mask next time, just not the pink one.\n  \nRead more",

              "text": "My initial encounter with these was until TikTok but I ordered them from Amazon for myself and my daughter for convenience and Prime shipping. There were two choices I think the one is a four-pack and the one I got is a 16 pack. The 16 pack will last you 4 months if you're doing it once a week as instructed.I open the top and two sides when I'm doing it just to have accessibility and to be able to use the remnants liquid in the pack after I'm done applying the facial part I put the liquid in the pack on my neck and chest.They are a little slippery when you take them out. I watched a video on how to apply it and did the bottom part first and then the top part sometimes I have to snip the top part near the nose to get it to fit properly but you don't have to in general.There are three pieces that are left over the two eye pieces and the lip piece. You can put them below your eyes or above your eyes on your brows and then put the mask over them which is what I do. Or you can put them under your eyes and put the mask over them but I find it doesn't absorb all the way in that location due to the double thickness I guess. The lip one you can put over your lip or put it on vertically over your throat where the skin can get a little saggy.Once you have it on it's best to sit back and relax for 30 minutes or so at about a 45° angle so it doesn't slip off. After about 10 to 15 minutes it doesn't slip around as much and after 30 it's obviously started absorbing and tends to stay pretty well.I haven't noticed any staining on the pillows or anything like that from it and by morning actually by 4 hours later it's completely absorbed and all you have left on your faces the plastic that it was attached to. You just pull that off and throw it away. It's white when you put it on and it's clear when it absorbs.I definitely noticed an improvement in my skin quality and the collagen sinks in easily and less about a week. I am a redhead with delicate skin and I haven't had any reaction to this product at all I know that other masks have caused problems for friends but I've used this one for over a year now and I love it. My daughter and I both use it weekly and they're easy to take with you if you're traveling great way to pamper your skin after a day outside on the beach.The price is reasonable for what it is and what it does. I've gotten several compliments on my skin and I'm over 60 so that saying something for the results!All in all this is a very good product, it doesn't smell and doesn't seem to have any impurities like some others. My skin isn't irritated by it and looks great afterwards. If you're wondering if it washes off once it's soaked in you can wash your face all you want but you're just going to have beautiful glowing cheeks. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this or give it as a gift!\n  \nRead more",
