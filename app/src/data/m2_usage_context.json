Both my mature skin and my daughter’s teenage skin showed visible improvement using these masks just once a week, addressing different needs while delivering consistent hydration and skin-smoothing results.The mask provides excellent moisture and leaves the skin feeling smooth, supple, glowing, and refreshed without irritation or stickiness. We use these both alongside other products from this line and in combination with other highly rated skincare brands, and they integrate well into a broader routine.What stands out most is the value. While not inexpensive, these masks rival far more expensive, luxury and prescription-grade skincare products we’ve used in the past—without the gimmicks. The quality and results justify the cost, must smell is wonderful, and this brand has become a regular part of our skincare routine.\n  \nRead more",

              "text": "My initial encounter with these was until TikTok but I ordered them from Amazon for myself and my daughter for convenience and Prime shipping. There were two choices I think the one is a four-pack and the one I got is a 16 pack. The 16 pack will last you 4 months if you're doing it once a week as instructed.I open the top and two sides when I'm doing it just to have accessibility and to be able to use the remnants liquid in the pack after I'm done applying the facial part I put the liquid in the pack on my neck and chest.They are a little slippery when you take them out. I watched a video on how to apply it and did the bottom part first and then the top part sometimes I have to snip the top part near the nose to get it to fit properly but you don't have to in general.There are three pieces that are left over the two eye pieces and the lip piece. You can put them below your eyes or above your eyes on your brows and then put the mask over them which is what I do. Or you can put them under your eyes and put the mask over them but I find it doesn't absorb all the way in that location due to the double thickness I guess. The lip one you can put over your lip or put it on vertically over your throat where the skin can get a little saggy.Once you have it on it's best to sit back and relax for 30 minutes or so at about a 45° angle so it doesn't slip off. After about 10 to 15 minutes it doesn't slip around as much and after 30 it's obviously started absorbing and tends to stay pretty well.I haven't noticed any staining on the pillows or anything like that from it and by morning actually by 4 hours later it's completely absorbed and all you have left on your faces the plastic that it was attached to. You just pull that off and throw it away. It's white when you put it on and it's clear when it absorbs.I definitely noticed an improvement in my skin quality and the collagen sinks in easily and less about a week. I am a redhead with delicate skin and I haven't had any reaction to this product at all I know that other masks have caused problems for friends but I've used this one for over a year now and I love it. My daughter and I both use it weekly and they're easy to take with you if you're traveling great way to pamper your skin after a day outside on the beach.The price is reasonable for what it is and what it does. I've gotten several compliments on my skin and I'm over 60 so that saying something for the results!All in all this is a very good product, it doesn't smell and doesn't seem to have any impurities like some others. My skin isn't irritated by it and looks great afterwards. If you're wondering if it washes off once it's soaked in you can wash your face all you want but you're just going to have beautiful glowing cheeks. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this or give it as a gift!\n  \nRead more",

My lips get extremely dry and cracked, especially at night, and this is the only product that actually keeps them soft and hydrated until morning. I apply it before bed and wake up with smooth, moisturized lips instead of flaky ones.A little goes a long way, so the jar lasts forever. It feels thick and nourishing without being sticky, and it also works great during the day as a lip balm. If you struggle with dry lips, this is 100% worth it.\n  \nRead more",
