Both my mature skin and my daughter’s teenage skin showed visible improvement using these masks just once a week, addressing different needs while delivering consistent hydration and skin-smoothing results.The mask provides excellent moisture and leaves the skin feeling smooth, supple, glowing, and refreshed without irritation or stickiness. We use these both alongside other products from this line and in combination with other highly rated skincare brands, and they integrate well into a broader routine.What stands out most is the value. While not inexpensive, these masks rival far more expensive, luxury and prescription-grade skincare products we’ve used in the past—without the gimmicks. The quality and results justify the cost, must smell is wonderful, and this brand has become a regular part of our skincare routine.\n  \nRead more",

              "text": "My initial encounter with these was until TikTok but I ordered them from Amazon for myself and my daughter for convenience and Prime shipping. There were two choices I think the one is a four-pack and the one I got is a 16 pack. The 16 pack will last you 4 months if you're doing it once a week as instructed.I open the top and two sides when I'm doing it just to have accessibility and to be able to use the remnants liquid in the pack after I'm done applying the facial part I put the liquid in the pack on my neck and chest.They are a little slippery when you take them out. I watched a video on how to apply it and did the bottom part first and then the top part sometimes I have to snip the top part near the nose to get it to fit properly but you don't have to in general.There are three pieces that are left over the two eye pieces and the lip piece. You can put them below your eyes or above your eyes on your brows and then put the mask over them which is what I do. Or you can put them under your eyes and put the mask over them but I find it doesn't absorb all the way in that location due to the double thickness I guess. The lip one you can put over your lip or put it on vertically over your throat where the skin can get a little saggy.Once you have it on it's best to sit back and relax for 30 minutes or so at about a 45° angle so it doesn't slip off. After about 10 to 15 minutes it doesn't slip around as much and after 30 it's obviously started absorbing and tends to stay pretty well.I haven't noticed any staining on the pillows or anything like that from it and by morning actually by 4 hours later it's completely absorbed and all you have left on your faces the plastic that it was attached to. You just pull that off and throw it away. It's white when you put it on and it's clear when it absorbs.I definitely noticed an improvement in my skin quality and the collagen sinks in easily and less about a week. I am a redhead with delicate skin and I haven't had any reaction to this product at all I know that other masks have caused problems for friends but I've used this one for over a year now and I love it. My daughter and I both use it weekly and they're easy to take with you if you're traveling great way to pamper your skin after a day outside on the beach.The price is reasonable for what it is and what it does. I've gotten several compliments on my skin and I'm over 60 so that saying something for the results!All in all this is a very good product, it doesn't smell and doesn't seem to have any impurities like some others. My skin isn't irritated by it and looks great afterwards. If you're wondering if it washes off once it's soaked in you can wash your face all you want but you're just going to have beautiful glowing cheeks. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this or give it as a gift!\n  \nRead more",

It’s incredibly lightweight, absorbs quickly, and layers effortlessly with the rest of my products. The texture is a little slimy at first, but I got over that quickly because of how well it sinks in and how hydrating it feels.What keeps me coming back is how much smoother and less blotchy my skin looks with consistent use. It gives my skin a healthy, hydrated glow without clogging pores or irritating sensitive, hormonal skin.If you want something gentle, effective, and easy to work into any routine, this serum is such a reliable boost for texture and hydration. slipp\n  \nRead more",

              "text": "⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Hydration-Focused Essence Supporting Skin Barrier and TextureSkin type: Normal to dry, sensitivePrimary concerns: Dehydration, dullness, compromised skin barrierUsage:This product was used consistently for several weeks as part of a daily skincare routine. It was applied once to twice daily after cleansing and before moisturizer. No additional hydrating essences or treatments were introduced during the evaluation period.Formulation & texture:The essence has a lightweight, viscous texture that spreads easily and absorbs quickly without leaving a sticky residue. Once absorbed, it leaves the skin feeling smooth and lightly cushioned. The formula is fragrance-free and did not cause irritation.Observed effects:With regular use, skin felt more hydrated, calmer, and more balanced. Areas prone to dryness appeared smoother, and overall skin texture looked more even. Improvements were gradual and cumulative, consistent with a barrier-supporting hydration product rather than an immediate corrective treatment.Strengths:• Provides sustained hydration• Supports skin barrier function• Lightweight and non-greasy• Suitable for sensitive skin• Layers well with serums and moisturizersConsiderations:• Texture may feel unusual initially for those new to essences• Very dry skin may require an additional occlusive moisturizerAssessment:This is a well-formulated hydrating essence designed to support moisture retention and skin comfort. It performs reliably with consistent use and integrates easily into both simple and multi-step skincare routines.⭐ Rating: 5 out of 5 stars\n  \nRead more",

It absorbs easily, layers well with other products, and feels hydrating without being heavy. There is no overpowering scent, a feature I appreciate. Using this product, I feel it has helped my skin tone and has helped keep my skin soft.  I've even had people comment that since I started this product, my skin looks more hydrated since it's become a part of my routine.This set also includes a mini retinol 0.1% cream, which I liked as a way to try it without committing to a full size right away. I've kept it to occasional use and appreciate having it included, alongside a product I already know works well for me.Overall, this feels like it would be a nice starter kit for someone interested in trying the product or for someone like me who already uses it as part of their routine. It offers solid value from a brand that I have relied on for a few years.For me, I'll be grabbing an extra kit or two so that I can keep it as a self care gift or a little holiday gift for someone special.\n  \nRead more",
