And the finish? So soft and healthy-looking, like your lips but better. I keep reaching for this all day long!Honestly, it lives in my purse, my desk, and my nightstand — I can’t recommend it enough.

              "text": "My initial encounter with these was until TikTok but I ordered them from Amazon for myself and my daughter for convenience and Prime shipping. There were two choices I think the one is a four-pack and the one I got is a 16 pack. The 16 pack will last you 4 months if you're doing it once a week as instructed.I open the top and two sides when I'm doing it just to have accessibility and to be able to use the remnants liquid in the pack after I'm done applying the facial part I put the liquid in the pack on my neck and chest.They are a little slippery when you take them out. I watched a video on how to apply it and did the bottom part first and then the top part sometimes I have to snip the top part near the nose to get it to fit properly but you don't have to in general.There are three pieces that are left over the two eye pieces and the lip piece. You can put them below your eyes or above your eyes on your brows and then put the mask over them which is what I do. Or you can put them under your eyes and put the mask over them but I find it doesn't absorb all the way in that location due to the double thickness I guess. The lip one you can put over your lip or put it on vertically over your throat where the skin can get a little saggy.Once you have it on it's best to sit back and relax for 30 minutes or so at about a 45° angle so it doesn't slip off. After about 10 to 15 minutes it doesn't slip around as much and after 30 it's obviously started absorbing and tends to stay pretty well.I haven't noticed any staining on the pillows or anything like that from it and by morning actually by 4 hours later it's completely absorbed and all you have left on your faces the plastic that it was attached to. You just pull that off and throw it away. It's white when you put it on and it's clear when it absorbs.I definitely noticed an improvement in my skin quality and the collagen sinks in easily and less about a week. I am a redhead with delicate skin and I haven't had any reaction to this product at all I know that other masks have caused problems for friends but I've used this one for over a year now and I love it. My daughter and I both use it weekly and they're easy to take with you if you're traveling great way to pamper your skin after a day outside on the beach.The price is reasonable for what it is and what it does. I've gotten several compliments on my skin and I'm over 60 so that saying something for the results!All in all this is a very good product, it doesn't smell and doesn't seem to have any impurities like some others. My skin isn't irritated by it and looks great afterwards. If you're wondering if it washes off once it's soaked in you can wash your face all you want but you're just going to have beautiful glowing cheeks. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this or give it as a gift!\n  \nRead more",

Redness looked reduced and my skin looked more balanced and fresh the next day. It’s a great option for gentle hydration when you have acne-prone skin but still want a glow. I would definitely repurchase.\n  \nRead more",

              "text": "⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Hydration-Focused Essence Supporting Skin Barrier and TextureSkin type: Normal to dry, sensitivePrimary concerns: Dehydration, dullness, compromised skin barrierUsage:This product was used consistently for several weeks as part of a daily skincare routine. It was applied once to twice daily after cleansing and before moisturizer. No additional hydrating essences or treatments were introduced during the evaluation period.Formulation & texture:The essence has a lightweight, viscous texture that spreads easily and absorbs quickly without leaving a sticky residue. Once absorbed, it leaves the skin feeling smooth and lightly cushioned. The formula is fragrance-free and did not cause irritation.Observed effects:With regular use, skin felt more hydrated, calmer, and more balanced. Areas prone to dryness appeared smoother, and overall skin texture looked more even. Improvements were gradual and cumulative, consistent with a barrier-supporting hydration product rather than an immediate corrective treatment.Strengths:• Provides sustained hydration• Supports skin barrier function• Lightweight and non-greasy• Suitable for sensitive skin• Layers well with serums and moisturizersConsiderations:• Texture may feel unusual initially for those new to essences• Very dry skin may require an additional occlusive moisturizerAssessment:This is a well-formulated hydrating essence designed to support moisture retention and skin comfort. It performs reliably with consistent use and integrates easily into both simple and multi-step skincare routines.⭐ Rating: 5 out of 5 stars\n  \nRead more",

              "text": "I really love this products and keep buying it all over again. I am on my 7th bottle. I have really dry skin (flakes since the weather and treatment), so the stickiness and hydrating really help my skin conditions and repair skin barrker. I have inflamtion pimple and while using it, the inflamation did go better.The feeling lingers on the skin for a very long time. After roughly 30 mins applying this products (when the linger feeling leaves), it leaves my skin a thin layer of filter (oil, i believe, from neither my skin or the product), which is glowing and really helps since my skin really need the hydration and that thin layer of oil to prevent water loss. It softens my skin. I used 3 pumps after cleansing. If you have try skin, i believe it worth. If you have oil or combination, adjust the using amount in order to prevent clog pore.\n  \nRead more",
